# GroceryList

This is a simple Python program using Kivy GUI that allows a user to add items to a grocery list with its name and price. 
Each item is modifiable and items that have been physically added to the shopping cart can be marked as added by pressing the cart button on the app.
The current date and total price shows at the top of the screen. The items list is a scrollable element.
The app has been deployed using Buildozer into an .apk bundle for use on an Android phone, and has been used and tested.

Limitations and/or bugs to fix:
  - The keyboard covers the input fields when opened
  - App not connected to a database
